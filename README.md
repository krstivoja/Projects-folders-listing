# Projects folders listing
Nicely styled projects folders list with icon and option to open admin link if you are using CMS. 

I created this project as I could not find simple, modern and responsive project lister for localhost and server. That's why I created my own. What I also found is that I'm typing "/wp-admin/" a lot. That is covered with included "Login" link for each project in the projects list.

**Project include 2 folders:**
* One with login and one without login screen. Both have:
* SCSS File with mobile and desktop brakepoint
* Generated CSS file
