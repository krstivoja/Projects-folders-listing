# Projects folders listing
Nicely styled projects folders list with icon and option to open admin link if you are using CMS. 

I created this project to use it for personal use but fill free to use it for your needs as well. I didn't manage to find some clean and modern project lister that is mobile ready as well. That's why I created my own. Also what I found out that I'm typing /wp-admin a lot so I included that as well.

**Project include 2 folders:**
* One with login and one without login screen. Both have:
* SCSS File with mobile and desktop brakepoint
* Generated CSS file
