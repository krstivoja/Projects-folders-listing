<h1 id="projectsfolderslisting">Projects folders listing</h1>

<p>Nicely styled projects folders list with icon and option to open admin link if you are using CMS.</p>

<p>I created this project as I could not find simple, modern and responsive project lister for localhost and server. That&#8217;s why I created my own. What I also found is that I&#8217;m typing &#8220;/wp-admin/&#8221; a lot. That is covered with included &#8220;Login&#8221; link for each project in the projects list.</p>

<p><strong>Project include 2 folders:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One with login (for server) and one without login screen (for localhost)</li>
<li>SCSS File with mobile and desktop brakepoint</li>
<li>Generated CSS file</li>
<li>CSS in index.php is pointed to github cdn.</li>
</ul>
